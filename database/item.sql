It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.\r\n\r\nPython is an easy-to-learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.\r\n\r\nWith its interpreted nature, Python\'s syntax and dynamic typing make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.\r\n\r\nPython supports multiple programming patterns, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.\r\n\r\nPython is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. It is a multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.\r\n\r\nWe don\'t need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed, so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.\r\n\r\nPython makes development and debugging fast because no compilation step is included in Python development, and the edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.\r\n\r\nPython has many web-based assets, open-source projects, and a vibrant community. Learning the language, working together on projects, and contributing to the Python ecosystem are all made very easy for developers.\r\n\r\nBecause of its straightforward language framework, Python is easier to understand and write code in. This makes it a fantastic programming language for novices. Additionally, it assists seasoned programmers in writing clearer, error-free code.\r\n\r\nPython is an open-source, cost-free programming language. It is utilized in several sectors and disciplines as a result.\r\n\r\nIn Python, code readability and maintainability are important. As a result, even if the code was developed by someone else, it is easy to understand and adapt by some other developer.\r\n\r\nPython has many third-party libraries that can be used to make its functionality easier.

It provides libraries to handle internet protocols such as HTML and XML, JSON, Email processing, request, beautifulSoup, Feedparser, etc. One of Python web-framework named Django is used on Instagram. Python provides many useful frameworks, and these are given below:\r\n\r\nDjango and Pyramid framework(Use for heavy applications)\r\nFlask and Bottle (Micro-framework)\r\nPlone and Django CMS (Advance Content management)\r\n2) Desktop GUI Applications\r\nThe GUI stands for the Graphical User Interface, which provides a smooth interaction to any application. Python provides a Tk GUI library to develop a user interface. Some popular GUI libraries are given below.\r\n\r\nTkinter or Tk\r\nwxWidgetM\r\nKivy (used for writing multitouch applications )\r\nPyQt or Pyside\r\n3) Console-based Application\r\nConsole-based applications run from the command-line or shell. These applications are computer program which are used commands to execute. This kind of application was more popular in the old generation of computers. Python can develop this kind of application very effectively. It is famous for having REPL, which means the Read-Eval-Print Loop that makes it the most suitable language for the command-line applications.\r\n\r\nPython provides many free library or module which helps to build the command-line apps. The necessary IO libraries are used to read and write. It helps to parse argument and create console help text out-of-the-box. There are also advance libraries that can develop independent console apps.\r\n\r\n4) Software Development\r\nPython is useful for the software development process. It works as a support language and can be used to build control and management, testing, etc.\r\n\r\nSCons is used to build control.\r\nBuildbot and Apache Gumps are used for automated continuous compilation and testing.\r\nRound or Trac for bug tracking and project management.\r\n5) Scientific and Numeric\r\nThis is the era of Artificial intelligence where the machine can perform the task the same as the human. Python language is the most suitable language for Artificial intelligence or machine learning. It consists of many scientific and mathematical libraries, which makes easy to solve complex calculations.\r\n\r\nImplementing machine learning algorithms require complex mathematical calculation. Python has many libraries for scientific and numeric such as Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, etc. If you have some basic knowledge of Python, you need to import libraries on the top of the code. Few popular frameworks of machine libraries are given below.\r\n\r\nSciPy\r\nScikit-learn\r\nNumPy\r\nPandas\r\nMatplotlib\r\n6) Business Applications\r\nBusiness Applications differ from standard applications. E-commerce and ERP are an example of a business application. This kind of application requires extensively, scalability and readability, and Python provides all these features.\r\n\r\nOddo is an example of the all-in-one Python-based application which offers a range of business applications. Python provides a Tryton platform which is used to develop the business application.\r\n\r\n7) Audio or Video-based Applications\r\nPython is flexible to perform multiple tasks and can be used to create multimedia applications. Some multimedia applications which are made by using Python are TimPlayer, cplay, etc. The few multimedia libraries are given below.\r\n\r\nGstreamer\r\nPyglet\r\nQT Phonon\r\n8) 3D CAD Applications\r\nThe CAD (Computer-aided design) is used to design engineering related architecture.

The standards to name an identifier are given underneath.\r\n\r\nThe variable\'s first character must be an underscore or alphabet (_).\r\nEvery one of the characters with the exception of the main person might be a letter set of lower-case(a-z), capitalized (A-Z), highlight, or digit (0-9).\r\nWhite space and special characters (!, @, #, %, etc.) are not allowed in the identifier name. ^, &, *).\r\nIdentifier name should not be like any watchword characterized in the language.\r\nNames of identifiers are case-sensitive; for instance, my name, and MyName isn\'t something very similar.\r\nExamples of valid identifiers: a123, _n, n_9, etc.\r\nExamples of invalid identifiers: 1a, n%4, n 9, etc.\r\nDeclaring Variable and Assigning Values\r\nPython doesn\'t tie us to pronounce a variable prior to involving it in the application. It permits us to make a variable at the necessary time.\r\nIn Python, we don\'t have to explicitly declare variables. The variable is declared automatically whenever a value is added to it.\r\nThe equal (=) operator is utilized to assign worth to a variable.\r\nObject References\r\nWhen we declare a variable, it is necessary to comprehend how the Python interpreter works.
