Both Rahul and rahul are distinct variables.\r\n\r\nIdentifier Naming\r\nIdentifiers are things like variables. An Identifier is utilized to recognize the literals utilized in the program. The standards to name an identifier are given underneath.\r\n\r\nThe variable\'s first character must be an underscore or alphabet (_).\r\nEvery one of the characters with the exception of the main person might be a letter set of lower-case(a-z), capitalized (A-Z), highlight, or digit (0-9).\r\nWhite space and special characters (!, @, #, %, etc.) are not allowed in the identifier name. ^, &, *).\r\nIdentifier name should not be like any watchword characterized in the language.\r\nNames of identifiers are case-sensitive; for instance, my name, and MyName isn\'t something very similar.\r\nExamples of valid identifiers: a123, _n, n_9, etc.\r\nExamples of invalid identifiers: 1a, n%4, n 9, etc.\r\nDeclaring Variable and Assigning Values\r\nPython doesn\'t tie us to pronounce a variable prior to involving it in the application. It permits us to make a variable at the necessary time.\r\nIn Python, we don\'t have to explicitly declare variables. The variable is declared automatically whenever a value is added to it.\r\nThe equal (=) operator is utilized to assign worth to a variable.\r\nObject References\r\nWhen we declare a variable, it is necessary to comprehend how the Python interpreter works. Compared to a lot of other programming languages, the procedure for dealing with variables is a little different.\r\n\r\nPython is the exceptionally object-arranged programming language; Because of this, every data item is a part of a particular class. Think about the accompanying model.', 'python-variable.png\r\n', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQT33yu9pY8?si=DIMUru90_QmlLf2v', 'https://take.quiz-maker.com/QET4T2U5G', 'saiyad shehnaz s', '2024-01-05', 4, 1, 'Variables', '10:00:34'),

The Python interpreter will automatically interpret the variable as an integer.\r\n\r\nWe can verify the type of the program-used variable thanks to Python. The type() function in Python returns the type of the passed variable.\r\nStandard data types\r\nA variable can contain a variety of values. On the other hand, a person\'s id must be stored as an integer, while their name must be stored as a string.\r\n\r\nThe storage method for each of the standard data types that Python provides is specified by Python. The following is a list of the Python-defined data types.\r\n\r\nNumbers\r\nSequence Type\r\nBoolean\r\nSet\r\nDictionary\r\nNumbers\r\nNumeric values are stored in numbers. The whole number, float, and complex qualities have a place with a Python Numbers datatype. Python offers the type() function to determine a variable\'s data type. The instance () capability is utilized to check whether an item has a place with a specific class.\r\nSequence Type\r\nString\r\nThe sequence of characters in the quotation marks can be used to describe the string. A string can be defined in Python using single, double, or triple quotes.\r\n\r\nString dealing with Python is a direct undertaking since Python gives worked-in capabilities and administrators to perform tasks in the string.\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with strings, the operation \"hello\"+\" python\" returns \"hello python,\" and the operator + is used to combine two strings.\r\n\r\nBecause the operation \"Python\" *2 returns \"Python,\" the operator * is referred to as a repetition operator.\r\nList\r\nLists in Python are like arrays in C, but lists can contain data of different types. The things put away in the rundown are isolated with a comma (,) and encased inside square sections [].\r\n\r\nTo gain access to the list\'s data, we can use slice [:] operators. Like how they worked with strings, the list is handled by the concatenation operator (+) and the repetition operator (*).\r\nTuple\r\nIn many ways, a tuple is like a list. Tuples, like lists, also contain a collection of items from various data types. A parenthetical space () separates the tuple\'s components from one another.\r\n\r\nBecause we cannot alter the size or value of the items in a tuple, it is a read-only data structure.\r\nDictionary\r\nA dictionary is a key-value pair set arranged in any order. It stores a specific value for each key, like an associative array or a hash table. Value is any Python object, while the key can hold any primitive data type.\r\n\r\nThe comma (,) and the curly braces are used to separate the items in the dictionary.\r\nBoolean\r\nTrue and False are the two default values for the Boolean type. These qualities are utilized to decide the given assertion valid or misleading. The class book indicates this. False can be represented by the 0 or the letter \"F,\" while true can be represented by any value that is not zero.\r\nSet\r\nThe data type\'s unordered collection is Python Set. It is iterable, mutable(can change after creation), and has remarkable components. The elements of a set have no set order; It might return the element\'s altered sequence. Either a sequence of elements is passed through the curly braces and separated by a comma to create the set or the built-in function set() is used to create the set. It can contain different kinds of values.\r\n\r\n', 'python-data-types.png', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_jm4xfXvuE?si=hO3ubu19bY8jnA8L', 'https://take.quiz-maker.com/QFYY25U62', 'saiyad shehnaz s', '2024-01-05', 4, 1, 'Datatypes', '00:04:22'),

The await and async keywords, for instance, were not introduced till Python 3.7. Also, in Python 2.7, the words print and exec constituted keywords; however, in Python 3+, they were changed into built-in methods and are no longer part of the set of keywords. In the paragraphs below, you\'ll discover numerous methods for determining whether a particular word in Python is a keyword or not.\r\n\r\nWrite Code on a Syntax Highlighting IDE\r\nThere are plenty of excellent Python IDEs available. They\'ll all highlight keywords to set them apart from the rest of the terms in the code. This facility will assist you in immediately identifying Python keywords during coding so that you do not misuse them.\r\n\r\nVerify Keywords with Script in a REPL\r\nThere are several ways to detect acceptable Python keywords plus know further regarding them in the Python REPL.\r\n\r\nLook for a SyntaxError\r\nLastly, if you receive a SyntaxError when attempting to allocate to it, name a method with it, or do anything else with that, and it isn\'t permitted, it\'s probably a keyword. This one is somewhat more difficult to see, but it is still a technique for Python to tell you if you\'re misusing a keyword.\r\n\r\nPython Keywords and Their Usage\r\nThe following sections categorize Python keywords under the headings based on their frequency of use. The first category, for instance, includes all keywords utilized as values, whereas the next group includes keywords employed as operators. These classifications will aid in understanding how keywords are employed and will assist you in arranging the huge collection of Python keywords.\r\n\r\nA few terms mentioned in the segment following may be unfamiliar to you. They\'re explained here, and you must understand what they mean before moving on:\r\nThe Boolean assessment of a variable is referred to as truthfulness. A value\'s truthfulness reveals if the value of the variable is true or false.\r\nIn the Boolean paradigm, truth refers to any variable that evaluates to true. Pass an item as an input to bool() to see if it is true. If True is returned, the value of the item is true. Strings and lists which are not empty, non-zero numbers, and many other objects are illustrations of true values.\r\n\r\nFalse refers to any item in a Boolean expression that returns false. Pass an item as an input to bool() to see if it is false. If False is returned, the value of the item is false. Examples of false values are \" \", 0, { }, and [ ].\r\n\r\nValue Keywords: True, False, None\r\nThree Python keywords are employed as values in this example. These are singular values, which we can reuse indefinitely and every time correspond to the same entity. These values will most probably be seen and used frequently.\r\n\r\nThe Keywords True and False\r\n\r\nThese keywords are typed in lowercase in conventional computer languages (true and false); however, they are typed in uppercase in Python every time. In Python script, the True Python keyword represents the Boolean true state. False is a keyword equivalent to True, except it has the negative Boolean state of false.\r\n\r\nTrue and False are those keywords that can be allocated to variables or parameters and are compared directly.\r\nIteration Keywords: for, while, break, continue\r\nThe iterative process and looping are essential programming fundamentals. To generate and operate with loops, Python has multiple keywords. These would be utilized and observed in almost every Python program. Knowing how to use them correctly can assist you in becoming a better Python developer.\r\n\r\nThe for Keyword\r\n\r\nThe for loop is by far the most popular loop in Python. It\'s built by blending two Python keywords. They are for and in, as previously explained.\r\n\r\nThe while Keyword\r\n\r\nPython\'s while loop employs the term while and functions similarly to other computer languages\' while loops. The block after the while phrase will be repeated repeatedly until the condition following the while keyword is false.\r\n\r\nThe break Keyword\r\n\r\nIf you want to quickly break out of a loop, employ the break keyword. We can use this keyword in both for and while loops.\r\n\r\nThe continue Keyword\r\n\r\nYou can use the continue Python keyword if you wish to jump to the subsequent loop iteration. The continue keyword, as in many other computer languages, enables you to quit performing the present loop iteration and go on to the subsequent one.', 'python_keyw.png', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_gnfezYobI?si=prCYGiVWhDA4ad8n', '', 'saiyad shehnaz s', '2024-01-05', 4, 1, 'keywords', '00:04:00'),

Comparison operators compare the values of the two operands and return a true or false Boolean value in accordance. The example of comparison operators are ==, !=, <=, >=, >, <. In the below table, we explain the works of the operators.\r\nAssignment Operators\r\nUsing the assignment operators, the right expression\'s value is assigned to the left operand. There are some examples of assignment operators like =, +=, -=, *=, %=, **=, //=\r\nBitwise Operators\r\nThe two operands\' values are processed bit by bit by the bitwise operators. The examples of Bitwise operators are bitwise OR (|), bitwise AND (&), bitwise XOR (^), negation (~), Left shift (<<), and Right shift (>>).\r\nLogical Operators\r\nThe assessment of expressions to make decisions typically uses logical operators. The examples of logical operators are and, or, and not. In the case of logical AND, if the first one is 0, it does not depend upon the second one. In the case of logical OR, if the first one is 1, it does not depend on the second one', 'python_opp.web file', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/iyOVgQDkx1E?si=ssiuG9RQoEGNpc3Z', 'https://take.quiz-maker.com/QBXRY34GO', 'saiyad shehnaz s', '2024-01-05', 4, 1, 'operators', '00:11:47'),

(27, 'History of Java', 'The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.', 'The principles for creating Java programming were \"Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic\". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early \'90s.\r\nCurrently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. Following are given significant points that describe the history of Java.\r\n\r\n1) James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.\r\n\r\n2) Initially it was designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.\r\n\r\n3) Firstly, it was called \"Greentalk\" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.\r\n\r\n4) After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.\r\n\r\nWhy Java was named as \"Oak\"?\r\n5) Why Oak? Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.\r\n\r\n6) In 1995, Oak was renamed as \"Java\" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.\r\n\r\nWhy Java Programming named \"Java\"?\r\n7) Why had they chose the name Java for Java language? The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were \"dynamic\", \"revolutionary\", \"Silk\", \"jolt\", \"DNA\", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell, and fun to say.\r\n\r\nAccording to James Gosling, \"Java was one of the top choices along with Silk\". Since Java was so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.\r\n\r\n8) Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office.\r\n\r\n9) Notice that Java is just a name, not an acronym.\r\n\r\n10) Initially developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.\r\n\r\n11) In 1995, Time magazine called Java one of the Ten Best Products of 1995.\r\n\r\n12) JDK 1.0 was released on January 23, 1996. After the first release of Java, there have been many additional features added to the language. Now Java is being used in Windows applications, Web applications, enterprise applications, mobile applications, cards, etc. Each new version adds new features in Java.\r\nJava Version History\r\nMany java versions have been released till now.

According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:\r\n\r\nJava syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).\r\nJava has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.\r\nThere is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.\r\nObject-oriented\r\nJava is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.\r\n\r\nObject-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.\r\n\r\nBasic concepts of OOPs are:\r\n\r\nObject\r\nClass\r\nInheritance\r\nPolymorphism\r\nAbstraction\r\nEncapsulation\r\nPlatform Independent\r\nJava is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides a software-based platform.\r\n\r\nThe Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it is a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. It has two components:\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment\r\nAPI(Application Programming Interface)\r\nJava code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode.

He realized that the web needed to become more dynamic. Thus, a \'glue language\' was believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the company recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed Scheme programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could start, the company merged with Sun Microsystems for adding Java into its Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were there: Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java\'s. It led to \'Javascript\'. Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of Javascript named \'Mocha\'. Later, the marketing team replaced the name with \'LiveScript\'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to \'JavaScript\'. From then, JavaScript came into existence.', 'javascript_history.webp', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZSAfo_RfuBo?si=WSlZGoF6l9HjSShD', '', 'prakash khant s', '2024-01-15', 4, 4, '#histroy', '00:07:00'),
